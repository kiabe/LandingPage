                            <div>
                                <p>This is Yabuki Kentaro's latest work, making its debut on June 2020. His past work include Black Cat (2000-2004), To Love Ru (2006-2017), and adapted both Mayoi Neko Overrun! (2010) and Darling in the Franxx (2018-2020) into manga form. As a long time fan of Yabuki Kentaro's work, I find it exciting to see his latest creation and would like to share its existence and generate discussion.</p>

                                <p>Matsuri Kazamaki is an exorcist ninja that thwarts all ayakashis looking to devour his beloved childhood friend Suzu Kanade! However, after a clash with Shirogane the King of Ayakashis, Matsuri had been cursed and transformed into a girl, thwarting any potential romance between him and Suzu! Or so it seems?</p>

                            <h2>Why should I read it?</h2>
                            <div>
                                <p>The series starts off with an interesting genderbender twist. Ayakashi Triangle explores this sudden change in one's gender identity through Matsuri's daily life and his interactions with the people around him. Furthermore, the supporting cast is colorful and vibrant with personality, with rarely a dull moment to be found. Lastly, the art is very pleasant, but it can be very risque at times, teetering just on the edge of indecency. If nothing else, Suzu Kanade is worth giving this series a try as she is horrendously down bad for her childhood friend, even willing to forego a traditional hetero relationship if it means she can be together with Matsuri.</p>
